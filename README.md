# 🖥️ System Monitor Tool

A **real-time system monitoring application** built in **C++** that displays CPU usage, memory utilization, and running processes — similar to the Linux `top` command.  
This version is designed to run smoothly on **macOS**, using **ncurses** for a terminal-based UI.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a system monitor tool in C++ that displays real-time information about system processes, memory usage, and CPU load, similar to the 'top' command.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 **Real-time updates** of CPU and memory usage  
- 🧠 **Displays process information:** PID, User, Command, Threads, CPU%, and Memory  
- ⚙️ **Sort processes** by CPU, Memory, or PID  
- 💀 **Kill processes** (SIGTERM or SIGKILL) directly from the interface  
- ⏱️ **Auto-refresh every few seconds**  
- 🎨 **Ncurses-based interactive UI**

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++17  
- **Libraries:** ncurses, libproc, mach  
- **Platform:** macOS  
- **Build Tool:** Make / CMake  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
